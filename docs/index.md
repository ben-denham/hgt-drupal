# The Hitchhiker's Guide to Drupal

Welcome to The Hitchhiker's Guide to Drupal!

## About this Guide

This guide aims to:

* Help you learn how to build websites with Drupal.
* Show you the best-practice, "Drupal Way" of working on Drupal sites.
* Save you time learning things "the hard way" by providing tips and
  gotchas.
* Be practical and applicable; teaching you how to accomplish common
  tasks rather than just explaining how something works.
* Reference existing documentation wherever possible; there is no
  point writing new documentation on a subject if perfectly good
  material already exists.
* Be primarily useful to proficient software developers who need to
  learn how to work with Drupal; in particular, developers who need to
  work on an existing Drupal site they did not build themselves.
* Be an opinionated guide that recommends a particular path, but
  acknowledges tradeoffs with alternative approaches.

## How to Read This Guide

You could just go through the guide from start to finish, or you can
also pick and choose the topics that you need to learn about. Each
section is self-contained and does not depend on knowledge from
elsewhere in the guide (except where noted).

## What Versions of Drupal Does This Guide Cover?

For the time being, this guide will focus on Drupal 7. However, as
soon as anyone wishes to write content for Drupal 8, a decision will
be made as to how to cover both in the guide (be it a separate branch,
a separate guide, or a single guide to cover both versions).
