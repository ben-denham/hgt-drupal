# Hitchhiker's Guide to Drupal

Welcome to the HitchHiker's Guide to Drupal!

## About this Guide

This guide aims to:

* Help you learn how to build websites with Drupal.
* Show you the best-practice, "Drupal Way" of working on Drupal sites.
* Save you time learning things "the hard way" by providing tips and
  gotchas.
* Reference existing documentation wherever possible; there is no
  point writing new documentation on a subject if perfectly good
  material already exists.
* Be primarily useful to proficient software developers who need to
  learn how to work with Drupal; in particular, developers who need to
  work on an existing Drupal site they did not build themselves.
* Be an opinionated guide that recommends a particular path, but
  acknowledges tradeoffs with alternative approaches.
